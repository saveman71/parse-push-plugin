Phonegap Parse.com Plugin
=========================

Phonegap 3.x plugin for Parse.com push service.

[Parse.com's](http://parse.com) Javascript API has no mechanism to register a device for or receive push notifications, which
makes it fairly useless for PN in Phonegap/Cordova. This plugin bridges the gap by leveraging native Parse.com SDKs
to register/receive PNs and allow a few essential methods to be accessible from Javascript.

How Is This Fork Different?
--------------------------

**API**

This plugin exposes the following native Android API push services to JS:

* **getInstallationId**( successCB, errorCB )
* **getSubscriptions**( successCB, errorCB )
* **subscribe**( channel, successCB, errorCB )
* **unsubscribe**( channel, successCB, errorCB )

ParsePushPlugin extends Parse.Events, and makes these notification events available:
`openPN, receivePN, receivePN:customEvt`. To handle notification events in JS, you can do this:

```javascript
ParsePushPlugin.on('receivePN', function(pn){
	console.log('yo i got this push notification:' + JSON.stringify(pn));
});

//customEvt can be any string of your choosing, i.e., chat, system, upvote, etc.
ParsePushPlugin.on('receivePN:chat', function(pn){
	console.log('yo i can also use custom event to keep things like chat modularized');
});

ParsePushPlugin.on('openPN', function(pn){
	//you can do things like navigating to a different view here
	console.log('Yo, I get this when the user clicks open a notification from the tray');
});
```



**Multiple notifications**

Prevent flooding the notification tray by retaining only the last PN with the same `title` field.
For messages without the `title` field, the application name is used. A count of unopened PNs is
also shown.

**Foreground vs. Background**

Only add an entry to the notification tray if the application is not running in foreground.
The actual PN payload is always forwarded to your javascript when it is received.

**Navigate to a specific view when user opens a notification**

Simply add a `urlHash` field in your PN payload that contains either a url hash, i.e. #myhash,
or a url parameter string, i.e. ?param1=a&param2=b. If `urlHash` starts with "#" or "?",
this plugin will pass it along as an extra in the android intent to launch your MainActivity.

For the cold start case, simply do this in your `MainActivity.onCreate()`:

```java
@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    //
    // your code...
    //

    String urlHash = intent.hasExtra("urlHash") ? intent.getStringExtra("urlHash") : "";
    loadUrl(launchUrl + urlHash);
}
```

If your app is already running (in the background, for example), and you want the PN open
action to trigger navigation to a different page/view within your app, just set a handler
for the `openPN` event, like so:

```javascript
ParsePushPlugin.on('openPN', function(pn){
	if(pn.urlHash){
		window.location.hash = hash;
	}
});
```

**Platforms**

For Android, Parse SDK v1.10.1 is used. This means GCM support. No more background process `PushService` tapping
device battery to duplicate what GCM already provides.

_I've only worked on the Android support for this fork. The iOS side is not yet up to date._


Installation
------------

```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/saveman71/parse-push-plugin
```


####Android Setup:
Phonegap/Cordova doesn't define a custom `android.app.Application`, it only defines an android `Activity`. With an `Activity` alone,
we should be able to receive PNs just fine while our app is running. However, if a PN arrives when the app is not running,
the app will be automatically invoked, and this plugin's `ParsePushPluginReceiver` runs before the `Activity` class or any javascript code
gets a chance to call `Parse.initialize()`. The result is a crash dialog. To fix this, do the following:

1. Define a custom Application class that calls `Parse.initialize()` in its `onCreate` method. This way, the Parse
subsystem gets initialized before the PN-handling code runs. Crash avoided. In your application's Java source path,
e.g., `platforms/android/src/com/example/app`, create a file named MainApplication.java and define it this way
    ```java
    package com.example.app;  //REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR package name

    import android.app.Application;
    import com.parse.Parse;
    import com.parse.ParseInstallation;

    public class MainApplication extends Application {
	    @Override
        public void onCreate() {
            super.onCreate();
            Parse.initialize(this, "YOUR_PARSE_APPID", "YOUR_PARSE_CLIENT_KEY");
            ParseInstallation.getCurrentInstallation().saveInBackground();
        }
    }
    ```
2. Now register MainApplication in AndroidManifest.xml so it's used instead of the default.
In the `<application>` tag, add the attribute `android:name="MainApplication"`. Obviously, you don't have
to name your application class this way, but you have to use the same name in 1 and 2.

3. Optional. To customize background color for the push notification icon in Android Lollipop, go to
your `platforms/android/res/values` folder and create a file named `colors.xml`. Paste the following
content in it and replace the hex color value of the form `#AARRGGBB` to your liking.

    ```xml
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <resources>
        <color name="parse_push_icon_color">#ff112233</color>
    </resources>
    ```


####Android Without GCM support:
If you only care about GCM devices, you're good to go. Move on to the [Usage](#usage) section.

The setup above is not enough for non-GCM devices. To support them, `ParseBroadcastReceiver`
must be setup to work properly. This receiver takes care of establishing a persistent
connection that will handle PNs without GCM. Follow these steps for `ParseBroadcastReceiver` setup:

1. Add the following to your AndroidManifest.xml, inside the `<application>` tag
    ```xml
    <receiver android:name="com.parse.ParseBroadcastReceiver">
       <intent-filter>
          <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />
          <action android:name="android.intent.action.USER_PRESENT" />
       </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
    ```

2. Add the following permission to AndroidManifest.xml, as a sibling of the `<application>` tag
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" />
    ```


Usage
-----
**Registering device**

Calls to register the device with Parse is done in java in the android MainApplication code.
It has to be this way because notifications can arrive and need to be handled when the webview 
and this javascript plugin are not yet loaded. See [Android Setup](#android-setup).

**API**

You can do any of the following

```javascript
ParsePushPlugin.getInstallationId(function(id) {
    alert(id);
}, function(e) {
    alert('error');
});

ParsePushPlugin.getSubscriptions(function(subscriptions) {
    alert(subscriptions);
}, function(e) {
    alert('error');
});

ParsePushPlugin.subscribe('SampleChannel', function(msg) {
    alert('OK');
}, function(e) {
    alert('error');
});

ParsePushPlugin.unsubscribe('SampleChannel', function(msg) {
    alert('OK');
}, function(e) {
    alert('error');
});

ParsePushPlugin.linkUser('userId', function(msg) {
    alert('OK');
}, function(e) {
    alert('error');
});
```


**Receiving push notifications**

Anywhere in your code, you can set a listener for notification events using the ParsePushPlugin object (it extends Parse.Events).
```javascript
if(window.ParsePushPlugin){
	ParsePushPlugin.on('receivePN', function(pn){
		alert('yo i got this push notification:' + JSON.stringify(pn));
	});

	//
	//you can also listen to your own custom subevents
	//
	ParsePushPlugin.on('receivePN:chat', chatEventHandler);
	ParsePushPlugin.on('receivePN:serverMaintenance', serverMaintenanceHandler);
}
```


**Silent Notifications**

For Android, a silent notification can be sent by omitting the `title` and `alert` fields in the
JSON payload. This means the push notification will not be shown in the system tray, but its JSON
payload will still be delivered to your `receivePN` and `receivePN:customEvt` handlers.


**Troubleshooting**
Starting with the Parse Android SDK v1.10.1 update, your app may crash at start and the log says
something about a missing method in OkHttpClient. Just update the cordova libs of your project
via `cordova platform update android`. If your previous cordova libs are old, you may run into
further compilation errors that has to do with the new cordova libs setting your android target
to be 22 or higher. Look at file `platforms/android/project.properties` and make sure that is
consistent with your `config.xml`
